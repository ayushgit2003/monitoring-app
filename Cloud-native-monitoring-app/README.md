# Cloud Native Resource Monitoring Python App

This is a Python application for monitoring resource usage in a cloud-native environment, such as Kubernetes. The app is built using Flask and psutil, and it can be run locally or containerized with Docker.

## 🌟 Features

- Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage of your Kubernetes nodes
- Visualize resource usage using interactive charts and graphs
- Easily deploy the application using Kubernetes Deployments and Services
- Containerized using Docker and pushed to AWS ECR for easy deployment on Kubernetes

## 🔑 Requirements

- Python3
- Flask
- psutil
- AWS
- Docker
- Kubernetes

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Part 1: Deploying the Flask application locally

**Step 1: Clone the code**

Clone the code from the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ashwaq06/Cloud-native-monitoring-app
```
**Step 2: Install dependencies**

The application uses the psutil, Flask, Plotly, and boto3 libraries. Install them using pip:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
**Step 3: Run the application**

To run the application, navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the following command:

```bash
$ python3 app.py
```
This will start the Flask server on localhost:5000. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/ on your browser to access the application.

### Part 2: Dockerizing the Flask application
**Step 1: Create a Dockerfile**

Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of the project with the following contents:
```bash
# Use the official Python image as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file to the working directory
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Set the environment variables for the Flask app
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Expose the port on which the Flask app will run
EXPOSE 5000

# Start the Flask app when the container is run
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```
**Step 2: Build the Docker image**

To build the Docker image, execute the following command:
```bash
$ docker build -t <image_name> .
```
**Step 3: Run the Docker container**

To run the Docker container, execute the following command:

```bash
$ docker run -p 5000:5000 <image_name>
```
This will start the Flask server in a Docker container on localhost:5000. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/ on your browser to access the application.

### Part 3: Pushing the Docker image to ECR 
**Step 1: Create an ECR repository**

Create an ECR repository using Python:

```py
import boto3

# Create an ECR client
ecr_client = boto3.client('ecr')

# Create a new ECR repository
repository_name = 'my-ecr-repo'
response = ecr_client.create_repository(repositoryName=repository_name)

# Print the repository URI
repository_uri = response['repository']['repositoryUri']
print(repository_uri)
```
**Step 2: Push the Docker image to ECR**

Push the Docker image to ECR using the push command on the console:

```
$ docker push <ecr_repo_uri>:
```
### Part 4: Creating an EKS cluster and deploying the app using YAML
**Step 1: Create an EKS cluster**

Create an EKS cluster and add node group.

**Step 2: Create a node group**

Create a node group in the EKS cluster.

**Step 3: Create deployment and service**
```yaml
#deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-flask-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-flask-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-flask-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-flask-container
        image: 568373317874.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-cloud-native-repo:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000


#service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-flask-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-flask-app
  ports:
  - port: 5000
```
- Make sure to modify the image name with the URI of your image.
- Before applying the configuration of the file, Ensure that your `kubectl` is configured to interact with your EKS cluster by running the following command:
 ```bash
aws eks --region <your-region> update-kubeconfig --name <your-cluster-name>
```
- Save the above YAML configurations into a file naming it as `eks.yaml` or any other name as per your wish. You can then apply these configurations to your Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl` apply command:
```bash
kubectl apply -f eks.yaml
```
To check the deployments
```bash
kubectl get deployment -n default
```
To check the service
```bash
kubectl get service -n default
``` 
To check the pods
```bash
kubectl get pods -n default
``` 

- Once the pod is up and running, you can expose the service using port-forwarding. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/<service_name> 5000:5000
```
This will allow you to access the service on your local machine at http://localhost:5000.
